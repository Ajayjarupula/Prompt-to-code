# Prompt-to-codes
# Round Alpha (Music Application Using LLM -Implementing Filtering and Search Features)

As technology is evolving, artificial intelligence is becoming an integral part of our daily lives. Large Language Models (LLMs),
such as ChatGPT and Gemini, have proven invaluable for tasks ranging from trip planning to workplace assistance. 
The human level interactions are making it possible to be accepted by a large number of people in the different domains. 
Harnessing their full potential requires expertise in prompt engineering to ensure effective and efficient interactions.
In this hackathon, your challenge is to leverage the power of LLMs to create a music application.
Your goal is to craft optimized prompts and use them to generate code that implements essential features for this application.
For this hackathon, the codes will be accepted in Python, Java or SQL.
